# AIRK
Gathering Straw for the Spinning Wheel. AIRK (pronounced "ark") is a personal project exploring the ways languages and existing systems of classifying the built environment can and will interact in a time of generative AI.


The raw material for Generative Artificial Intelligence has thus far been textual and pictorial in nature. Architecture is resistant to a single approach or mode of representation. It is currently possible to generate a two dimensional or even three dimensional representation from a text or image prompt, but architecture goes beyond just representations on the internet or in monographs and architectural histories.

Architecture is layered with affinities to culture, ritual, art, craft, building technologies, climate, usage, function, industry and tradition. Through out time architects have attempted to classify and promote principles of architecture by which to guide the production and aid in understanding of architecture. However, language has been a limitation in describing any artistic endeavor . As the familiar quote goes "Writing about music is like dancing about architecture". As a result, the "knowledge" or "intelligence" we have about architecture is limited to the sources and experiences which form our individual knowledge. 

Technologies are springing up now for a transformation of how intelligence is constructed. With proper tools and techniques we can now identify and use latent patterns which are present in the data we feed a generative artificial intelligence, then utilize the existance of those patterns to generate according to our needs, or for those who want to expand our knowledge - use such a model to translate, whether that is simply across the languages used to describe architecture or by finding the latent language of architecture itself.

This is an important time for this work. Previous attempts at taxonomies are many, but now we have the ability to gather, collate, sift and join these models and taxonomies into a single vessel. I call this AIRK - an AI ark containing two of each species, preserving historical patterns and generating new ones.
